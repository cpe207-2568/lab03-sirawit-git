          <h5 class="card-title font-soft">Chill in Cafe</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I'm someone who really enjoys going to cafés — whether it's to work, watch movies, draw, or just hang out with friends. I feel like cafés have become a part of my life because they offer cool air-conditioning, internet access for both work and gaming, and a peaceful atmosphere. It would be a perfect day off if I didn’t have to work and could simply relax at a café.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title font-soft">Drawing</h5>
          <p class="card-text">As I mentioned, I love going to cafés — and drawing is one of the things I often do there. I started taking drawing seriously for the first time in high school because it felt like a way to release my emotions through the tip of a pen. When I draw, I feel deeply focused and present, and time always seems to fly by. But ever since I started university, I’ve had less time to draw. I really hope I’ll be able to return to it again soon.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title font-soft">Basketball</h5>
          <p class="card-text">This is probably the only sport that connects me with people. I play casually, only in the mornings or evenings when I’m free. I started out not knowing how to play at all, but now I’ve reached a point where I can hold my own on the court. It feels great to see how my skills have improved over time. I love basketball.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Another important best friend of mine is my dog, LEO. He’s adorable and incredibly loyal to me. His job is to guard our house and garden. He’s very smart and often barks to alert my family whenever something seems off. Now that I’m studying far from home, I really miss him.</p>
