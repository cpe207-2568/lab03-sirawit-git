          <p class="card-text">I have extensive experience in academic science competitions, most of which are related to inventions and robotics. The invention I’m most proud of is a device that measures soil mineral content and moisture levels, helping farmers determine the N-P-K nutrient ratio in their soil. Another notable project is a semi-autonomous cart system for transporting patients by following color-coded lines on the floor. I have mainly participated in competitions such as STEM, 46ICT, National Science Week, and Physics Battle.</p>

          <p class="card-text">My family runs a small restaurant in our garden. When I’m at home and have free time — ever since I was young — I usually help out, either in the kitchen or by serving food. On days when there are no customers or when the restaurant is closed, I help with gardening tasks such as making compost, wrapping fruits, digging soil, or planting trees. The environment is very green and peaceful. I’d love for everyone to come and try the food at our restaurant at least once.</p>
